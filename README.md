### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my knowledge of building with a **mobile-first workflow**.  
Starting with small screen layouts first made it easier to scale the design up to larger devices in a structured way.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing responsive layouts and reusable CSS components.
In future projects, Iâ€™ll also explore Grid and possibly utility classes for faster styling.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me for selecting the Box shadow. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
